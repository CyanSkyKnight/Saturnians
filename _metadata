  "description" : "THIS MOD REQUIRES A CHARACTER CREATION EXTENDER. \n\nAny character creation extender that works with the latest version of Starbound, like [url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=729426722] Xbawks Character Extender [/url], should work.\n\n\nSaturnians v1.3.6 is out, Adding spaceships to find!.\n--------\n\nSaturnians are moth wizards. For many generations, they have passed down techniques for making \"light weaving\" wands. They yearn to explore the unknown and meet new species. Saturnian villages are usually built on floating islands. When Saturnians ally with each other they typically connect these cities together into a larger network. Most Saturnians are from the largest network of cities, the country Solalei.\n\n================\nThis mod includes:\n\n\tTwo playable \"species\". Saturnians are the main species, while Thaumoth are a bonus nocturnal variant. Thaumoth are ever so slightly different. Both species share the same visuals. Lore-wise, they're the same species, and the two names can be used interchangeably. \n\n\tTons and tons of customization options. Lots of body/hair colors, antennae styles, hair styles, and eye colors/shapes, as well as options for neck fluff or probosci.\n\n\tTwo villages, part of two different Saturnian factions: The first is a sky city with many different shops, while the second is a small village built by wasp-mimicing Saturnians.\n\n\tNew racial armor and weapons, including wands, scythes, rapiers, bows, maces, and some others.\n\t\n\tA hat converter, for reshaping around 180 vanilla hats and helmets for Saturnians to wear\n\n\tThe ability to craft nectar from flowers, and silk from nectar.\n\n\tA special loom that crafts lots of new clothes, special dyes and wings.\n\n\tA furniture table that any species can craft.\n\n\t16+ craftable wings that remove fall damage and lowers gravity slightly when worn.\n\n\tNew furniture and tiles.\n\n\tA custom respawn animation, new racial mech parts, realistic moth noises!\n\n\tA Palette-swapped glitch ship. Bronze with sandstone bricks. It has no backgrounds, so feel free to add as many windows as you'd like.\n\t\n\n================================\nF.A.Q.- Read before commenting please!â€‹\n================================\n\nQ: Where are their wings?\n\tA: The wings are back items. Your shiplocker has a basic set, but you can craft more kinds of wings for very cheap with a Saturnian loom.\n\nQ: Where do I get the new items from?\n\tA: Most weapons, armor and furniture are crafted where you would craft the vanilla versions of them (Anvil, Workbench). Clothes, wings, new dyes, and other extra things are crafted with the Saturnian Loom you get from your shiplocker. Villagers sell plenty of new items as well.\n\nA list of most tile and object IDs (Everything before v1.2) can be found here: https://pastebin.com/gfxbh7A7\n\nA list of most npc IDs (Everything before v1.2) can be found here: https://pastebin.com/PT0twJsq\n\nA list of most weapon IDs (1.3.2.1) can be found here: https://pastebin.com/ENP8XztZ\n\n\nQ: How do I get Saturnian tenants?\n\tA: Place Saturnian furniture before placing a colony deed. Some basic Saturnian furniture is crafted at a workbench like other furniture is.\n\n\nQ: Is there Frackin Races support?\n\tA: Frackin Races adds stats to both Saturnians. Both Saturnian species gain a different set of stats and weapon bonuses. Weapon bonuses also work with Saturnian versions of scythes, rapiers, and maces just like they would for Frackin Universe's own. Questions about stat bonuses or racial tech do not go here.\n\nQ: Where can the villages spawn?\n\tA: The Sky Town (id: saturnskygarden) most often appears on snow worlds. It can appear above Forest, Desert, Jungle, Snow, Tundra, Alien, or Savannah Planets. They are always attached to the ground with a giant chain surrounded by a two guard towers. They can be rare though, especially if you have other village/dungeon adding mods.\n\n\tThe Wasp Mimic village (id: saturnMimic) most often appears on jungle worlds. It can appear on Forest, Jungle, Alien, or Savannah Planets.\n\nQ: How do I remove the protection from the sky villages?\n\tA: At the top of the center tower, there's a generator. Attack it until it explodes! (Just don't get caught in the blast!)\n\t\nQ: What IDs do this mod use?\n\tA: As of 1.1 It now uses the material IDs 54700-54720 and the liquid ID 36 . All ID names are prefixed with \"Sat\" or \"Saturn\", if your mod uses the same prefix for names, there is a risk of conflicts.\n\n==============================================================\n==============================================================\nMods that add features to, or require the Saturnians: https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/discussion/1103027918/2139714324759602249/\n==============================================================\n==============================================================\n\n\n\n\n==============================================================\n==============================================================\nQ: I want to make an addon or mod this mod.
