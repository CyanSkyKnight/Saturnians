    "Light bows are built with a traditional body and silk string, but requires no arrows thanks to a glowing, gelatinous orb floating in front of the arrow rest. This orb forms the shape of an arrow when pulled back. When a sudden force is applied, like a bow string being released, the arrow crystallizes and shines brightly, acting as a sort of beacon. After firing, the orb quickly reforms from the archer's energy. Timing is critical for using this bow; if not properly timed, the arrow will be dim and will quickly melt."
