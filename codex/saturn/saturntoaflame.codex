	"Light is the source of our magic. Ever since ancient times, we have been able to weave light into energy and matter. We seem to unconsciously try to follow most light sources, though most of us can avoid chasing them if we try hard enough. To prevent unnecessary tragedies, our technomancers have wisely installed special solar filters on our ships' windows."
