# Saturnians

Saturnians are moth wizards. For many generations, they have passed down techniques for making "light weaving" wands. They yearn to explore the unknown and meet new species. Saturnian villages are usually built on floating islands. When Saturnians ally with each other they typically connect these cities together into a larger network. Most Saturnians are from the largest network of cities, the country Solalei.

# This mod includes:

	Two playable "species". Saturnians are the main species, while Thaumoth are a bonus nocturnal variant. Thaumoth are ever so slightly different. Both species share the same visuals. Lore-wise, they're the same species, and the two names can be used interchangeably. 

	Tons and tons of customization options. Lots of body/hair colors, antennae styles, hair styles, and eye colors/shapes, as well as options for neck fluff or probosci.

	Two villages, part of two different Saturnian factions: The first is a sky city with many different shops, while the second is a small village built by wasp-mimicing Saturnians.

	New racial armor and weapons, including wands, scythes, rapiers, bows, maces, and some others.
	
	A hat converter, for reshaping around 180 vanilla hats and helmets for Saturnians to wear

	The ability to craft nectar from flowers, and silk from nectar.

	A special loom that crafts lots of new clothes, special dyes and wings.

	A furniture table that any species can craft.

	16+ craftable wings that remove fall damage and lowers gravity slightly when worn.

	New furniture and tiles.

	A custom respawn animation, new racial mech parts, realistic moth noises!

	A Palette-swapped glitch ship. Bronze with sandstone bricks. It has no backgrounds, so feel free to add as many windows as you'd like.
